# GooseOps/Ops
## About
This repository will be a project designed around operating software.  Think DevOps, CI/CD,
Automation, Infracture, SRE, etc.  This is a personal repository, and my goal is to showcase
as many different types of hosting, deploying, operating, and automating that I am familiar
with.  Also, within this repository will be the website and application that will demonstrate
these different hosting capabilities and knowledge.

## Contributing
Because this is a personal project designed to showcase my capabilites and those of
GooseOps, LLC, I will not be taking contributions to this project at this time. However, please
do not hesitate to open issues or feature requests that you think will improve the project or that
you'd like to see added.

## General use
Please note that the code in this repository will attempt to follow best practices.  However,
modules may not contain features that you might employ personally to better configure your 
infrastructure/deployments to suit your needs.  If you would like to use the information in this
repository, by all means do so, but the code should be treated more like a boilerplate than a drop 
in replacement for production workloads.

## Documentation
Each directory will have a README.md explaining what that directory is for and how to use or
deploy it.
