## Scripts
This directory will house any python or bash scripts for personal uses or operations.

### Directory Structure
- Scripts at the root of this directory will be fully developed and designed with bash or python best practices.
- `personal_use` - This will be a directory at the root of the `/ops/scripts` directory.  Scripts in this directory will be simple scripts that aren't fully developed and mostly just used for quick one-off tasks that I need to do for home automation or otherwise.
