print("""Once upon a time, in a deep and 'dark' forest, there lived two ogres named 'Gromm' and 'Kragg'. 
Gromm was a huge, 'hulking' brute with 'bulging' muscles and a fierce scowl on his face. Kragg, on the 
other hand, was a bit smaller and leaner, but he was just as 'ferocious' as Gromm when it came to defending 
his 'family'.
Gromm and Kragg were neighbors, and they had known each other since they were 'young'. They both had large 
families of ogres, with plenty of little ones 'running' around and causing chaos.
Despite their rough and tough exteriors, Gromm and Kragg were both very devoted to their 'families'. They 
spent long hours 'hunting' for food, making sure their homes were secure, and teaching their children how to 
be strong and fierce like them.
One day, however, a group of humans stumbled upon the ogres' forest. They were a group of adventurers, 
seeking treasure and adventure in the wilderness. When they saw the ogres and their families, they 
immediately drew their weapons and prepared to attack.
Gromm and Kragg knew they had to defend their families at all costs. They charged at the humans, roaring 
and swinging their massive clubs. The battle was intense and brutal, but eventually, the ogres emerged 
victorious.
After the battle, Gromm and Kragg sat down together to rest and talk. They realized that, despite their 
differences, they both shared a deep love for their families and would do anything to protect them. From 
that day on, they became close friends and allies, working together to keep their families safe from any 
threats that might come their way.
And so, the two ogres and their families lived happily ever after, in their deep and dark forest, far away 
from the prying eyes of humans and other dangers.
