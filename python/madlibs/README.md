# Madlibs
- As I understand them, Madlibs are a story with key words blanked out, allowing the madlibber to fill in the blanks
- Generally it is played by requesting from the madlibber specific parts of speech that make sense in the blanks
- Also, generally, the madlibber does not know the story ahead of time, thus making the final reading surprising and oft times comical.

## Goals
- Build this application from scratch without using tutorial style coding. (This is an early project so I will be using the internet to get past obstacles.)
- Create a series of madlibs that can be played on the command line.
- Create a web interface that can serve the madlibs in a UI experience.
- Create a Django app that allows admins to build their own madlibs and stores the created madlibs in a DB.

### TODO
- Generate a simple sentence with a blank that will mimic the inputs needed for a madlib.
- Create a system for retrieving user input.
- Have the ability to specify part of speech.
- Have a way to send back the final sentence after input.
