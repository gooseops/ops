This is a guessing game that will hopefully take on a form of it's own
as I expand out the functions and possibilities making it more difficult to 
guess the correct answer and more humorous when guessing incorrectly.

TO DOS
# Handle input exceptions with funny script response
# Handle negative numbers differently than letters, and differently than special characters
# Bring in randomized responses to guesses
# include stuff about getting closer to the guess
# loop until right
# select random function that behaves differently each time a guess occurs
# else statement for incorrect guesses
